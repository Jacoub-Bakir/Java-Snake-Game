# 🐍 Java Snake Game 🎮

## 📝 Description

The "Java Snake Game" is my first project in Java and Java Swing. It's a classic and entertaining game where players control a snake that moves around the screen. The main purpose of this project is to learn and practice Java coding skills and explore Java Swing for building graphical user interfaces.

As a beginner in Java development, I embarked on this journey to challenge myself and gain hands-on experience with Java programming and GUI development using Java Swing. Creating the "Java Snake Game" allowed me to apply what I've learned and dive deeper into the world of programming.

The game's development journey has been both fun and enlightening, as I learned about game logic, user input handling, and graphical rendering. I'm excited to share this project with others and showcase my progress in the world of Java development.

I hope you enjoy playing the "Java Snake Game" as much as I enjoyed building it. Let's continue learning and coding together!
